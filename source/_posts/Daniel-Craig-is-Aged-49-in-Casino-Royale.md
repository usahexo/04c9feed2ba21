His age is definitely not a hindrance to looking amazing on-screen, and he could definitely give many young actors a run for their money.

Craig’s impressive physique isn’t the only thing that makes him perfect for the role of Bond – he also has the necessary acting skills and charisma required for the part. He is able to convey a sense of toughness, intelligence, and strength, which are all important characteristics for James Bond.

Craig has commented that he doesn’t plan to stick with the role of Bond indefinitely, but we hope that he will continue to play 007 for many years to come.

In 2006, Craig was cast as James Bond in Casino Royale, making him the sixth actor to play the role of 007. He reprised the role for subsequent films Quantum of Solace (2008), Skyfall (2012) and Spectre (2015).

Craig is known for being selective about his roles and for taking his time before accepting a part. In an interview with The Telegraph, he said: "I'm quite choosy about what I do... I'm not one for doing things for money." And "It's not about how much you get paid... It's about how much fun you're going to have making the movie."

Craig's performance as Bond is credible and believable, thanks in part to his physical preparation for the role.

#  How old is Daniel Craig in Casino Royale?

Daniel Craig's age isn't actually mentioned in Casino Royale, but since he was born on 2 March 1968, we can work it out. He would have been 38 years old when the film was released in 2006.

#  Daniel Craig is almost 50 in Casino Royale

Casino Royale is Daniel Craig's first movie as James Bond. It was released in 2006, when Craig was 38 years old. In the movie, Bond tracks down the terrorist financier Le Chiffre in order towinning back the money lost at a high-stakes poker game.

Craig reprised his role as Bond for the next two movies, Quantum of Solace and Skyfall. In Spectre, released in 2015, he is shown as aging and weathered, with more lines on his face than in the earlier movies. He is 49 years old in Spectre.

Craig has not announced whether he will continue to play Bond after Spectre. If he does, it is likely that he will be 50 or even older by the time the next movie is released. This would make him one of the oldest actors to play 007.

Roger Moore was the oldest James Bond at age 57 in A View to a Kill. Sean Connery was only 36 when he played Bond for the first time in Dr. No, making Craig's age at Casino Royale seem even more impressive. Other Bonds who were over 50 include George Lazenby (50), Timothy Dalton (53) and Pierce Brosnan (57).

The producers of Casino Royale apparently chose Craig because they wanted a "blond bombshell" type of actor who could play a convincing action hero despite being over 30. It remains to be seen how well Daniel Craig can portray an older James Bond in future movies.
