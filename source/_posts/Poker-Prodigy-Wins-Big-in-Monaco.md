#  Poker Prodigy Wins Big in Monaco

At only 21-years old, poker prodigy Liv Boeree has already achieved great success in the gaming world. This week, she took first place in the €25,000 buy-in Monaco Poker Tournament, earning herself a tidy €1 million prize.

This win comes on the heels of another impressive victory for Boeree; only last month, she won the $100,000 buy-in super high roller event at the Aussie Millions. In total, her live tournament earnings exceed $4 million.

What is it that makes Boeree such a successful player? Her ability to read her opponents and adapt to their strategies is certainly one key factor. As poker columnist Remko Rinkema puts it: “Liv is one of those rare players that can not only quickly calculate ranges and equities in complex spots but also put herself in her opponents’ shoes to try and understand their thought processes.”

In addition to her strategic prowess, Boeree is also known for her unshakeable composure under pressure. This was on full display in Monaco this week, as she played some of the most intense final table hands of her career.

Asked about her thoughts on the win, Boeree said: “It feels amazing! I came here with the intention of winning – I’ve been playing really well recently – so it’s nice to have been able to do that. The final table was really tough but I managed to stay focused and make good decisions when it mattered."

Boeree will now turn her attention back to online poker, where she currently ranks #7 in the world on PocketFives.com. With continued success like this, it's safe to say that there's plenty more big things in store for this young phenom.
