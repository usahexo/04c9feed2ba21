#  What is the Red Queen Blackjack game?

The Red Queen Blackjack game is a new and innovative blackjack game that offers players an exciting and unique gaming experience. The game is based on the classic blackjack game, but features a number of exciting new twists that make it more exciting and challenging.

In the Red Queen Blackjack game, players are dealt two cards face up and one card face down. They must then decide whether to hit or stand. If they hit, they are dealt another face up card and must again decide whether to hit or stand. If they stand, their turn is over and they compare their hand to the dealer's hand to see who has won.

The key difference in the Red Queen Blackjack game is that the face down card is turned over at the end of each player's turn. This means that players can change their decisions based on what they see other players doing. For example, if a player has a low card face up and another player has a high card face up, they may want to hit in order to try and tie or beat the other player's hand.

The Red Queen Blackjack game also features an exciting side bet called "Queen". If a player gets a blackjack (an Ace plus any ten value card) with their two face up cards, they automatically win the Queen Side Bet. This side bet pays out 3:1 on your original bet amount, making it well worth taking a chance on.
