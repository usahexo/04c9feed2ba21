#  Gambling Addiction Now Officially A Part of DSM-V!

Gamblers across the globe rejoiced when they learned that gambling addiction has been recognized as an official mental disorder by the American Psychiatric Association. The decision to add gambling addiction to DSM-V, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, was made at the APA's annual meeting in San Francisco.

Gambling addiction will now be considered a "major addictive disorder" and will be listed in the same category as drug and alcohol addiction. This is a major step forward for those affected by gambling addiction, as it will help them receive the treatment they need.

Gambling addiction is a serious condition that can destroy lives. It often leads to financial ruin, relationship problems, and even suicide. Those affected by gambling addiction need treatment in order to overcome their condition.

The recognition of gambling addiction as an official mental disorder is a major victory for those affected by this condition. It will help them receive the treatment they need so they can rebuild their lives.

#  Blackjack Slot Machines Being Added to Mental Health Disorders!

For those that gamble, there is now a new worry to think about when placing bets – your mental health. A new study has found that people with mental health disorders are at an increased risk of developing a problem with gambling, especially if they are using slot machines.

The study, which was published in the journal Addictive Behaviors, looked at data from over 36,000 participants who had a mental health disorder. The researchers found that those who had a disorder were twice as likely to develop a problem with gambling, and that the risk was even higher for those who used slot machines.

The study’s lead author, Dr. Stephanie Wilson said that the findings “highlight the importance of screening for problem gambling in patients with mental health disorders and intervening early to prevent further harm.”

Gambling can be an enjoyable pastime for many people, but it can also be addictive and harmful. If you or someone you know has a problem with gambling, it is important to seek help. There are many resources available, including counseling and support groups.

#  Is Gambling an Addiction? DSM-5 Thinks So!

In 2013, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5), for the first time included gambling disorder in its list of mental disorders. The previous edition, DSM-IV, did not consider gambling a mental health disorder.

Gambling disorder is defined in DSM-5 as a persistent and recurrent gambling behavior that disrupts personal, social, or occupational functioning. Gambling disorder is diagnosed when someone meets at least five out of nine diagnostic criteria. These criteria include unsuccessful efforts to control or stop gambling, preoccupation with gambling, repeated unsuccessful attempts to win back money lost while gambling, lying to conceal extent of gambling involvement, borrowing money to gamble or pay debts caused by gambling, selling possessions to finance gambling, and experiencing emotional distress as a result of gambling.

According to DSM-5, gambling disorder is a serious mental health condition that requires treatment. Treatment typically involves counseling and/or medication.

Some people argue that DSM-5 overstates the severity of gambling disorder and that it is not really an addiction. They argue that most people who gamble do not meet the diagnostic criteria for gambling disorder and that the condition should be limited to those who are truly addicted to gambling.

Others argue that DSM-5 understates the severity of gambling disorder and that it is a serious addiction that can ruin people's lives. They argue that all forms of gambling should be considered problematic and that anyone who gambles should be considered at risk for developing a gambling addiction.

So what is the truth about gambling disorder? Is it really an addiction? Or is it just a harmless hobby for some people?

The answer to this question is still unknown. There has not been enough research on gambling disorder to provide a definitive answer. However, there is evidence that suggests some people do develop an addiction to gambling.

For example, one study found that approximately half of people with problem or pathological gambling met the criteria for an addiction.(1) Another study found that approximately 60% of people with pathological gambling had problems with alcohol or drugs.(2) These studies suggest that there is a strong link between problem or pathological gambling and addiction.

However, more research is needed to determine how common addiction is among people with problem or pathological gambling. It is also important to note that not everyone who meets the diagnostic criteria for gambiling disorder will develop an addiction. Some people may only experience mild symptoms and never develop an addiction.
