#  Ignition Casino Offers How To Show The Cards On A Fold Feature For Online Poker Players 

The Ignition Casino poker room offers a Fold button feature that conceals your cards from the other players, which is great for online poker players who like to keep their playing style secret. In this guide we will show you how to use this Fold button, and give you a few tips on how to make the most of it.

To fold your hand, click on the Fold button in the bottom right corner of your poker window. This will minimize your hand and conceal your cards from the other players. You can then reopen your hand by clicking on the Hand History button in the bottom left corner of your poker window.

When you fold your hand, you are not eliminated from the hand - you are just out of contention for the pot. If one or more players remain in the hand after you fold, they will continue to play until one of them has won all of the chips.

There are several reasons why you might want to fold your hand. Here are a few tips on when to fold:

- If you don't have anything good, folding is usually a good move. There's no point in risking chips when you don't have a good chance of winning.

- If there's a lot of betting going on and you don't think you can win, it's often best to fold. It's not worth risking more money than you have to.

- If another player has already shown strength betting, it may be wise to fold. When another player raises or reraises, it's generally because they have a strong hand - so folding is often the best option.
