#  Green Casino Chips Worth Much More Than Traditional Red Ones!

In recent years, there has been a shift in the color of casino chips from the traditional red to green. This is because green chips are worth much more than red ones!

There are a few different reasons for this. The first is that the manufacture of green chips is more expensive because the material used is harder to come by. Additionally, casinos tend to reserve their green chips for high-stakes games, meaning that there are fewer of them in circulation. This makes them rarer and therefore more valuable.

Even if you're playing at a low-stakes table, it's worth trying to get your hands on some green chips. Not only will you enjoy a better gaming experience, but you could also walk away with a bit of extra money in your pocket!

#  Trump It Deluxe Game with Green Casino Chips is Taking the World by Storm!

TrumpIt Deluxe is a brand new board game that simulates a presidential election campaign. What could be more fun than to play the game with your friends and family? The game is played with two decks of cards, red for the Republicans and blue for the Democrats. Players can choose any candidate from either party, or they can come up with their own.

Players rolls a die to move around the board, and landing on different squares will give them different opportunities. They can collect donations, make speeches, attack their opponents, and much more. The first player to reach the oval office wins the game.

TrumpIt Deluxe is available now on Amazon and other online retailers. It comes complete with a game board, 4 pawns, 2 decks of cards (52 cards each), 1 die, and an instruction booklet. The suggested retail price is $39.99 but it’s currently being offered at a discounted price of $27.99. Order your copy today!
