#  Dolores Del Rio's Blackjack Strategy: When to Stop Taking Another Card

Dolores Del Rio is famously known as a great blackjack player. She always had a keen sense when to stop taking another card and when to hold out for a better hand. Here are her three simple tips on how to play blackjack like a pro:

1. Know when to hold out: A lot of players make the mistake of hitting on 16 or lower, but this can be very risky. In general, you should only hit if the dealer is showing 2-6. If the dealer has anything else up, then you should stand.

2. Watch the other players: When playing blackjack in a casino, it's important to keep an eye on what the other players are doing. If they're all hitting and busting, then you should probably stand! Conversely, if everyone is standing with good hands, then it might be time to take that extra card.

3. Use basic strategy charts: There are plenty of basic strategy charts available online which can help you make the right decisions while playing blackjack. It's important to familiarize yourself with these charts before playing so that you're not making any costly mistakes.
