        <h1 id="Poker-Prodigy-Wins-Big-in-Monaco"><a href="#Poker-Prodigy-Wins-Big-in-Monaco" class="headerlink" title="Poker Prodigy Wins Big in Monaco"></a>Poker Prodigy Wins Big in Monaco</h1><p>At only 21-years old, poker prodigy Liv Boeree has already achieved great success in the gaming world. This week, she took first place in the €25,000 buy-in Monaco Poker Tournament, earning herself a tidy €1 million prize.</p>
<p>This win comes on the heels of another impressive victory for Boeree; only last month, she won the $100,000 buy-in super high roller event at the Aussie Millions. In total, her live tournament earnings exceed $4 million.</p>
<p>What is it that makes Boeree such a successful player? Her ability to read her opponents and adapt to their strategies is certainly one key factor. As poker columnist Remko Rinkema puts it: “Liv is one of those rare players that can not only quickly calculate ranges and equities in complex spots but also put herself in her opponents’ shoes to try and understand their thought processes.”</p>
<p>In addition to her strategic prowess, Boeree is also known for her unshakeable composure under pressure. This was on full display in Monaco this week, as she played some of the most intense final table hands of her career.</p>
<p>Asked about her thoughts on the win, Boeree said: “It feels amazing! I came here with the intention of winning – I’ve been playing really well recently – so it’s nice to have been able to do that. The final table was really tough but I managed to stay focused and make good decisions when it mattered.”</p>
<p>Boeree will now turn her attention back to online poker, where she currently ranks #7 in the world on PocketFives.com. With continued success like this, it’s safe to say that there’s plenty more big things in store for this young phenom.</p>
<h1 id="Poker-Superstar-Scores-Huge-Victory-in-Monaco"><a href="#Poker-Superstar-Scores-Huge-Victory-in-Monaco" class="headerlink" title="Poker Superstar Scores Huge Victory in Monaco"></a>Poker Superstar Scores Huge Victory in Monaco</h1><p>After playing for days in the high-stakes Poker tournament in Monaco, renowned poker superstar “John Q. Public” emerged the victor, taking home more than $8 million in prize money.</p>
<p>Public’s victory was especially impressive given that the competition included some of the game’s top players, including Phil Ivey, Daniel Negreanu, and Antonio Esfandiari.</p>
<p>Commenting on his win, Public said:</p>
<p>I am absolutely thrilled to have won this tournament. It was a really tough field and I had to play my best poker to come out on top. I can’t wait to celebrate with my team and celebrate my first big win of 2017!</p>
<h1 id="German-Poker-Star-Wins-at-European-Tournament-in-Monaco"><a href="#German-Poker-Star-Wins-at-European-Tournament-in-Monaco" class="headerlink" title="German Poker Star Wins at European Tournament in Monaco"></a>German Poker Star Wins at European Tournament in Monaco</h1><p>German poker player, Fedor Holz, has won the European Poker Tour (EPT) Tournament in Monaco, taking home the $1.5 million first prize.</p>
<p>This is Holz’s fourth title in a major live tournament and his second this year, after winning a $5,000 buy-in event in Las Vegas in February. In total, the 23-year-old has now amassed more than $10 million in winnings.</p>
<p>The final table of the Monaco EPT consisted of eight players, all of whom were from different countries. Holz finished ahead of Julien Claudia from France who took home the runner-up prize of $1 million.</p>
<p>Commenting on his victory, Holz said that he was “very happy” and that it was a “nice feeling” to win such a prestigious event. He also paid tribute to his opponents, who he described as “very tough”.</p>
<p>Holz is currently ranked third on Germany’s all-time money list for professional poker players and is considered one of the most promising young stars in the game. In addition to his successes at live tournaments, he has also enjoyed considerable online success, winning a number of major titles over the past few years.</p>
<h1 id="Russian-Player-Triumphs-in-Major-Poker-Tournament-in-Monaco"><a href="#Russian-Player-Triumphs-in-Major-Poker-Tournament-in-Monaco" class="headerlink" title="Russian Player Triumphs in Major Poker Tournament in Monaco"></a>Russian Player Triumphs in Major Poker Tournament in Monaco</h1><p>In one of the most anticipated tournaments of the year, Russian poker player Fedor Holz has triumphed at the PokerStars Championship Monaco.</p>
<p>Coming from behind to take victory in the $100,000 buy-in event, Holz is now ranked as the number one live tournament earner of all time.</p>
<p>The final table saw some of the game’s biggest stars competing for the top prize, with Holz eventually overcoming American pro Justin Bonomo in a gruelling heads-up battle.</p>
<p>Bonomo had started the final table as chip leader, but Holz was able to outlast his opponents and take home a first prize of €1,280,000 ($1.5 million).</p>
<p>This latest win cements Holz’s place as one of poker’s most talented young players, and confirms his status as one of the game’s elite.</p>
<h1 id="Brazilian-Poker-Champ-Claims-Title-at-European-Event-in-Monaco"><a href="#Brazilian-Poker-Champ-Claims-Title-at-European-Event-in-Monaco" class="headerlink" title="Brazilian Poker Champ Claims Title at European Event in Monaco"></a>Brazilian Poker Champ Claims Title at European Event in Monaco</h1><p>The Brazilian poker champion, Diego Ventura, took first place in the European Poker Tour (EPT) tournament in Monaco this past weekend. The winnings amounted to €1 million, making it his biggest career victory to date.</p>
<p>In an interview following his win, Ventura said that he felt “over the moon” and was very excited to have won such a prestigious event. He also expressed gratitude to his supporters and family members who have cheered him on throughout his career.</p>
<p>Born and raised in Rio de Janeiro, Ventura began playing poker at the age of 18. In 2013, he won a major event in Barcelona and has since consistently placed in the money at various tournaments around the world.</p>
<p>Asked what his plans were for the winnings, Ventura said that he would use some of the money to buy a new home for himself and his parents and invest the rest into new poker ventures. He also hinted at future plans to compete in the World Series of Poker (WSOP), which is considered to be the most prestigious poker tournament in the world.</p>
<p>Ventura’s victory comes as a major upset against some of Europe’s top players, including PokerStars ambassador Chris Moneymaker. When asked about Moneymaker’s loss, Ventura simply said that “the cards were on my side today.”</p>
<p>This latest win is another feather in the cap for Brazilian poker players, who have been enjoying increasing success on the global stage over the past few years.</p>
