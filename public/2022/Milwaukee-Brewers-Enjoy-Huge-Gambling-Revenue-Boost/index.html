The Brewers were eliminated by the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NLCS, but their success on the field was good news for the team’s bottom line.</p>
<p>According to a report from the Nevada Gaming Control Board, the Brewers generated $4.9 million in gambling revenue during the 2018 season. That’s more than double what they earned during the 2017 season ($2.3 million).</p>
<p>Brewers president Peter Feigin credited the team’s resurgence on the field with the increase in gambling revenue.</p>
<p>“We put a pretty good product on the field and people responded,” Feigin said.</p>
<p>The Brewers are one of six MLB teams that earn at least $1 million from gambling each year. The other teams are the Boston Red Sox, Chicago Cubs, Houston Astros, New York Yankees and Seattle Mariners.</p>
<h1 id="Gambling-Powers-Milwaukee-Brewers-to-New-Heights"><a href="#Gambling-Powers-Milwaukee-Brewers-to-New-Heights" class="headerlink" title="Gambling Powers Milwaukee Brewers to New Heights"></a>Gambling Powers Milwaukee Brewers to New Heights</h1><p>In baseball, teams are always looking for an edge that can put them over the top. For the Milwaukee Brewers, that edge has come in the form of gambling.</p>
<p>The Brewers made headlines before the season began when they inked free agent outfielder Lorenzo Cain to a five-year, $80 million contract. At first glance, this appear to be a hefty price tag for a player who isn’t considered a star. However, if you look at it from the perspective of a team that’s looking to make a deep playoff run, it makes much more sense.</p>
<p>That’s because Cain is one of the best all-around players in baseball. Not only does he have good bat speed and power, but he also has great speed and defense. This makes him the perfect player to put at the top of the lineup or in center field.</p>
<p>The Brewers knew that they could get better by adding Cain and his gambling skills to their squad. And so far this season, it’s paid off in a big way.</p>
<p>The Brewers currently sit atop the National League Central with a record of 43-32. This is thanks in part to their offense, which is averaging 5.1 runs per game. Cain has been a big part of this offense, batting .290 with 11 home runs and 38 RBIs.</p>
<p>But it’s not just Cain who’s been performing well for Milwaukee. Many of their other players have stepped up as well. Jesus Aguilar has been one of the biggest surprises for the team, batting .316 with 21 home runs and 66 RBIs. Travis Shaw has also had a strong year, batting .272 with 18 home runs and 58 RBIs.</p>
<p>With players like these leading the way, it’s no wonder that Milwaukee is having so much success this season. And if they continue to play well down the stretch, they could very well make it all the way to the World Series.</p>
<h1 id="Brewers’-Gambling-Revenue-Benefits-Players-Team-and-Fans"><a href="#Brewers’-Gambling-Revenue-Benefits-Players-Team-and-Fans" class="headerlink" title="Brewers’ Gambling Revenue Benefits Players, Team and Fans"></a>Brewers’ Gambling Revenue Benefits Players, Team and Fans</h1><p>It has long been known that major league baseball players are some of the best compensated athletes in all of professional sports. But what many people may not know is that a good chunk of that money comes from revenue generated by casino gambling.</p>
<p>According to a recent study by the University of Las Vegas, casino gambling accounted for nearly a third of the revenue collected by MLB teams in 2015. That amounts to over $1 billion in profits shared by players, team owners and fans.</p>
<p>The study also found that casinos located close to ballparks generate more revenue for teams than those located farther away. For example, the Milwaukee Brewers earned an estimated $14 million from casino gambling in 2015, more than any other team in the league.</p>
<p>Brewers’ owner Mark Attanasio was quick to point out that the casino money benefits everyone involved with the team. “The players get a significant percentage of it,” he said. “The team gets a significant percentage of it. The ballpark operator gets a significant percentage of it. It’s something that we’re all very proud of.”</p>
<p>Players also spoke positively about the arrangement, with outfielder Ryan Braun calling it a “win-win-win.” “The players obviously benefit financially,” he said. “But I think it also creates a better relationship with the fans.”</p>
<p>Team officials noted that the added revenue has helped them keep ticket prices affordable and maintain a competitive team on the field. “It’s important to us that our fans have access to affordable tickets,” said Brewers COO Rick Schlesinger. “And this additional revenue helps us do that.”</p>
<p>So while some may see MLB’s relationship with casinos as a negative, the reality is that it is actually good for everyone involved - players, teams and fans alike</p>
<h1 id="More-Money-For-Brewers-Means-Greater-Opportunities-To-Win"><a href="#More-Money-For-Brewers-Means-Greater-Opportunities-To-Win" class="headerlink" title="More Money For Brewers Means Greater Opportunities To Win"></a>More Money For Brewers Means Greater Opportunities To Win</h1><p>The Milwaukee Brewers have been on a tear recently, and there’s no reason to believe that this newfound success will stop anytime soon.</p>
<p>With more money available to spend on players, the Brewers now have a greater opportunity to win games and make a deep playoff run.</p>
<p>The front office has already made some major moves over the past few weeks, and it seems likely that they will continue to invest in the team in order to bring home a championship.</p>
<p>Fans of the team are undoubtedly excited about the prospects for the future, and there’s no telling what this roster might be able to achieve.</p>
<p>One thing is for sure: the Brewers are definitely one of the teams to watch in 2019.</p>
<h1 id="Brewers’-Gambling-Earnings-Help-Keep-Clubs-Competitive"><a href="#Brewers’-Gambling-Earnings-Help-Keep-Clubs-Competitive" class="headerlink" title="Brewers’ Gambling Earnings Help Keep Clubs Competitive"></a>Brewers’ Gambling Earnings Help Keep Clubs Competitive</h1><p>Brewers are always gambling on the new season. They never know how their players will perform and how the fans will react. There are only a few guaranteed contracts, and everyone else is playing for their spot on the team. This makes for an exciting season, but it also puts the Brewers in a precarious financial situation.</p>
<p>Most of the Brewers’ income comes from ticket sales. But because of the team’s volatility, fans often don’t know whether they will be good or bad until late into the season. This means that many tickets go unused, and the Brewers lose out on potential revenue.</p>
<p>In addition, most of the Brewers’ players are not signed to long-term contracts. This means that if the team does not perform well, they can be replaced by cheaper players. This also hurts the Brewers financially, as they need to spend more money on new players each year.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the Brewers have been able to make money through gambling. This allows them to keep their best players and compete with other teams in their division. Without this income, the Brewers would likely be unable to field a competitive team each year.</p>
